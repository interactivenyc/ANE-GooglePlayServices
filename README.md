# ANE-GooglePlayServices
Adobe AIR ANE Project - this example illustrates a problem, and doesn't work!


This Android ANE will work if you comment out the GooglePlayServicesUtils references in this file:

https://github.com/interactivenyc/ANE-GooglePlayServices/blob/master/SPK-GPS_Java_Eclipse/src/com/speakaboos/ane/gps/testGPS.java

This project can be built with the ANT script in the SPK-GPS_Build folder. Just navigate to that folder and run "ant buildANE." To build the test GPS.apk file and install it on your Android device, run "ant buildTest."

I've tried to make this as simple as possible, in order to ask for help getting it to work. If you have any questions, please email me at steve+github@speakaboos.com.
